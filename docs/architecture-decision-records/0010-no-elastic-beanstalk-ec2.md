# 10. Not Using Elastic Beanstalk or EC2

Date: 2024-02-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When deploying applications to AWS, there are traditional approaches like Elastic Beanstalk and standalone EC2 instances that have been widely used. However, these approaches often involve more operational overhead and don't align with modern cloud-native practices.

## Decision

Explicitly exclude AWS Elastic Beanstalk and direct EC2 deployments from our deployment strategies, focusing instead on modern serverless and container orchestration services.

### Reasons for Exclusion

1. **Elastic Beanstalk**
   - Abstracts away important deployment concepts
   - Limited control over infrastructure
   - Higher operational costs
   - Less flexible scaling options
   - Harder to implement modern deployment patterns

2. **Direct EC2 Usage**
   - Requires manual instance management
   - More complex security maintenance
   - Higher operational overhead
   - Less cost-effective for variable workloads
   - Limited auto-scaling capabilities

### Preferred Alternatives

1. **AWS Lambda**
   - Serverless compute
   - Automatic scaling
   - Pay-per-use pricing
   - Zero infrastructure management

2. **Container Services**
   - Amazon ECS with Fargate
   - Amazon EKS
   - Better resource utilization
   - Modern orchestration capabilities

## Consequences

### Positive
- Reduced operational overhead
- More predictable costs
- Better scalability
- Improved security posture
- Focus on modern practices
- Easier maintenance
- Better resource utilization
- Simplified deployment processes

### Negative
- May require learning new concepts
- Initial setup complexity
- Different debugging approaches
- New monitoring requirements

## Implementation Notes

### Migration Considerations
- Existing EC2-based applications need containerization
- Stateful applications require careful planning
- Session management may need redesign
- Consider cold start implications

### Best Practices
1. Use Infrastructure as Code
2. Implement proper logging
3. Design for statelessness
4. Plan for scalability
5. Consider resource limits

### Deployment Strategy
- Use AWS SAM for Lambda
- Implement ECS Task Definitions
- Define Kubernetes manifests
- Automate all deployments

## Compliance

- No direct EC2 instance provisioning
- No Elastic Beanstalk environments
- All deployments must use approved services
- Infrastructure must be defined as code
- Regular security updates must be automated
