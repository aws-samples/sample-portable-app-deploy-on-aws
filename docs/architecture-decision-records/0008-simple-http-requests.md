# 8. Simple HTTP Requests Implementation

Date: 2024-02-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When building a project focused on demonstrating different architectural patterns and deployment strategies, the complexity of the API implementation can either help or hinder the learning experience. Complex API features like WebSockets, GraphQL, or streaming could obscure the main architectural and deployment concepts.

## Decision

Implement simple HTTP REST endpoints using basic CRUD operations to maintain focus on architectural patterns and deployment strategies.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Basic REST Endpoints**
   ```typescript
   // Example endpoint structure
   GET    /users         // List users
   POST   /users         // Create user
   GET    /users/:id     // Get user by ID
   DELETE /users/:id     // Delete user
   ```

2. **Simple Request/Response Model**
   - JSON payloads
   - Standard HTTP status codes
   - Basic error handling
   - Synchronous operations

3. **Minimal Middleware**
   - Basic error handling
   - JSON parsing
   - Request logging
   - CORS support

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear focus on architectural patterns
- Easier to understand deployment configurations
- Simplified testing scenarios
- Reduced cognitive load
- Faster implementation
- Better portability across deployment targets
- Easier debugging and troubleshooting

### Negative
- Not representative of complex real-world APIs
- Limited demonstration of advanced HTTP features
- May need significant changes for real-world scenarios
- Potential future refactoring for advanced features

## Compliance

- All endpoints must use standard HTTP methods
- Response payloads must be JSON
- No WebSocket or streaming implementations
- No GraphQL endpoints
- Keep middleware to essential functions only
- Document all endpoints clearly
- Maintain consistent error response format
