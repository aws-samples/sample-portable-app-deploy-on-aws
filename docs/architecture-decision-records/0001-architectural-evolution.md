# 1. Multiple Architecture Patterns Implementation

Date: 2024-02-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When demonstrating the ability to deploy applications across different AWS compute services (Lambda, ECS, EKS), it's crucial to show that various architectural patterns can be successfully deployed using the same deployment strategies. This helps prove the flexibility and robustness of modern deployment approaches.

## Decision

Implement four different architectural patterns in the same project:

### 1. Monolithic Architecture
- Single codebase with all functionality
- Direct function calls between components
- Simplest form of architecture
- Starting point for architectural evolution

### 2. Layered Architecture
- Organized in horizontal layers
- Clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data
- Structured dependencies between layers
- Traditional and well-understood pattern

### 3. Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)
- Core business logic isolated from external concerns
- Ports define interfaces for communication
- Adapters implement external interactions
- Better separation of concerns

### 4. Clean Architecture
- Strict dependency rules
- Independent of frameworks
- Highly testable
- Maximum separation of concerns

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Deployment Flexibility Demonstration**
   - Proves any architecture can be deployed to modern services
   - Shows architecture doesn't limit deployment options
   - Demonstrates deployment process consistency

2. **Learning Value**
   - Clear progression of architectural patterns
   - Practical examples of each pattern
   - Real-world implementation reference
   - Understanding of trade-offs

3. **Code Evolution**
   - Shows how code can evolve
   - Demonstrates refactoring paths
   - Illustrates architectural transformation
   - Progressive complexity introduction

4. **Comparison Opportunity**
   - Direct comparison between patterns
   - Clear view of differences
   - Understanding of each pattern's strengths
   - Better decision-making basis

### Negative

1. **Project Complexity**
   - Multiple implementations to maintain
   - More code to manage
   - Increased testing requirements
   - Larger codebase

2. **Learning Curve**
   - Need to understand multiple patterns
   - More documentation required
   - Complex project structure
   - Higher onboarding effort

3. **Maintenance Overhead**
   - Updates needed across all implementations
   - Multiple testing suites
   - More potential for bugs
   - Increased build time

## Implementation Notes

### Common Elements
- Same business logic across all patterns
- Consistent API endpoints
- Shared deployment configurations
- Common testing strategies

### Best Practices
1. Keep implementations independent
2. Maintain consistent naming
3. Document key differences
4. Use shared utilities where appropriate
5. Consistent error handling
6. Standard logging approach

### Version Control
- Clear separation between patterns
- Dedicated folders for each architecture
- Shared deployment scripts
- Common configuration when possible
