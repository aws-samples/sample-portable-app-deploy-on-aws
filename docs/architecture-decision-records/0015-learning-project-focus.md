# ADR-0015: Learning Project Focus - Excluding Production Concerns

## Status
Accepted

## Context
This project serves as a learning platform for understanding software architecture patterns and deployment strategies. While security, CI/CD pipelines, and performance optimizations are crucial in production environments, including these aspects could distract from the core educational goals and make the project more complex than necessary.

## Decision
We will intentionally exclude or minimize focus on the following production-grade concerns:

1. **Security**
   - No implementation of complex authentication/authorization
   - Basic security practices only where necessary
   - No focus on security hardening or compliance

2. **CI/CD**
   - No implementation of complex deployment pipelines
   - Manual deployment steps to better understand the process
   - Basic build scripts only where needed

3. **Performance**
   - No focus on optimization techniques
   - Basic performance considerations only where necessary
   - No implementation of caching, load balancing, etc.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clearer focus on architectural patterns and their evolution
- Simpler codebase that's easier to understand and modify
- Reduced learning curve for newcomers
- More accessible examples of architectural concepts
- Faster iteration and experimentation

### Negative
- Not suitable for direct production use
- May need significant enhancement for real-world deployment
- Could develop habits that need adjustment in production settings

### Notes
- When using this project as a reference, teams should add appropriate security, CI/CD, and performance measures based on their production requirements
- This decision aligns with our goal of providing clear, focused learning examples rather than production-ready solutions
