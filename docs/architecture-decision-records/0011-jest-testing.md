# 11. Jest Testing Framework Adoption

Date: 2024-02-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

A consistent and reliable testing framework is crucial for maintaining code quality across different architectural patterns and deployment strategies. The project needs a testing solution that can handle unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests while being easy to configure and use.

## Decision

Adopt Jest as the primary testing framework for all Node.js code in the project, leveraging its comprehensive feature set and ecosystem.

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Test Configuration**
   ```javascript
   // jest.config.js
   module.exports = {
     preset: 'ts-jest',
     testEnvironment: 'node',
     coverageDirectory: 'coverage',
     collectCoverageFrom: [
       'src/**/*.ts',
       '!src/**/*.test.ts',
     ],
     testMatch: ['**/*.test.ts'],
   };
   ```

2. **Testing Levels**
   - Unit Tests: Individual components and functions
   - Integration Tests: Component interactions
   - E2E Tests: Full API endpoints with Supertest

3. **Key Features Usage**
   - Mocking capabilities for external dependencies
   - Snapshot testing for response structures
   - Coverage reporting
   - Test environment setup/teardown
   - Parallel test execution

### Testing Examples

1. **Unit Test**
   ```typescript
   describe('UserService', () => {
     it('should create a new user', () => {
       const user = new User('test@example.com');
       expect(user.email).toBe('test@example.com');
     });
   });
   ```

2. **API Test with Supertest**
   ```typescript
   describe('User API', () => {
     it('should create a user', async () => {
       const response = await request(app)
         .post('/users')
         .send({ email: 'test@example.com' });
       expect(response.status).toBe(201);
     });
   });
   ```

## Consequences

### Positive
- Unified testing approach across all architectures
- Built-in mocking capabilities
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Rich assertion library
- Active community and ecosystem
- Easy CI/CD integration
- Comprehensive documentation
- Watch mode for development

### Negative
- Learning curve for Jest-specific features
- Additional dev dependencies
- Configuration complexity for advanced scenarios
- Potential test execution time in large suites

## Implementation Notes

### Best Practices
1. Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
2. Use descriptive test names
3. Implement proper test isolation
4. Maintain test coverage thresholds
5. Use appropriate mocking strategies

### File Organization
```
src/
├── component/
│   ├── component.ts
│   ├── component.test.ts
│   └── __mocks__/
│       └── dependencies.ts
```

### CI/CD Integration
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
test:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - run: npm install
    - run: npm test
    - run: npm run test:coverage
```

## Compliance

- All new code must include tests
- Maintain minimum 80% code coverage
- Tests must be independent and repeatable
- Use appropriate testing levels
- Document complex test setups
- Regular test maintenance required
